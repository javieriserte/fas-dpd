This is an example of use of FAS-DPD.

The file 'Cyto_c_ox.fas' contains an alignment of several nucleotide sequences of Cytochrome C Oxidase enzyme from different organisms.

The file 'Run.bat' is a batch file with the options of execution:

	java -cp ..\bin\;..\lib\* fasdpd.FASDPD // FAS-DPD is written in Java. These option are for Java Virtual Machine, not FAS-DPD.
	/INFIlE: "Cyto_c_ox.fas"                // Read source alignment from "Cyto_c_ox.fas" file.         
	/OUTFILE: "Cyto_c_ox.fas.primers"       // Write selected primers to "Cyto_c_ox.fas.primers".
	/GCFILE: "StandardCode"                 // Read Genetic Code from "StandardCode" file. Althought is not used when the source alignment is a DNA alignment, it is always required.
	/isDNA                                  // Treat the alignment as DNA.
	/FDEG                                   // Filter Primers that ends with a degenerated base.
	/Frep                                   // Filter Primers that have the last two bases repeated.
	/Q: 100                                 // Retrieve the one hundred highest score primers.
	/profile: "Cyto_c_ox.fas.profile"       // Creates a histogram of positions of resulting primers.
                                            // Histogram values are stored in "Cyto_c_ox.fas.profile".
                                            // Cyto_c_ox.fas.profile.plt is a simple script yto view the
                                            // histogram in GNU-PLOT
