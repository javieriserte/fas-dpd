# FAS-DPD - Family Specific Degenerate Primer Design program:
Version 1.4.2

FAS-DPD is a command line software that designs degenerated oligonucleotides to
use in PCR in order to amplify new members of a family of sequences
FAS-DPD is written in Java, so you will need a Java Virtual Machine to run it.

## Usage

    java -jar fasdpd.1.4.2.cli.jar fasdpd.FASDPD 'Commands'

## Commands

### Required commands

- Infile: '/infile' : Path to a Fasta file with the starting alignment.
- Outfile: '/outfile' : Path to a file where resulting primers will be stored.
- GCfile: '/gcfile' : Path to a file containg the genetic code that will be
  used.

### Optional commands
- Quantity: '/q' : The number of primers to search.
- Staring Point: '/startingpoint' : The position of the alignment where start
  the search.
- Ending Point: '/endpoint' : The position of the alignment where finish the
  search.
- Is DNA: '/isdna' : Treat the sequences in input alignment as DNA sequences. By
  default: is assumed as DNA.
- Is Protein: '/isprotein' : Treat the sequences in input alignment as protein
  sequences. By default: is assumed as DNA.
- Filter Repeated End: '/frep' : Discard primers with the last two bases
  repeated.
- Filter Degenerated End: '/fdeg' : Discard Primers with the last base
  degenerated.
- Complementary Strand: '/ComplementaryStrand' : Search the primers in the
  complementary strand.
- Profile: '/profile' : Generates an histogram of sites of the alignment
  occupied by primers. Also provides a simple script to generate '.png' and
  '.ps' graphic output with Gnu-Plot.
- Primer Minimum Length: '/lenMin' : With '/lenMax' option permits evaluate
  primers of different sizes. Default value: 20
- Primer Maximum Length: '/lenMax' : With '/lenMin' option permits evaluate
  primers of different sizes. Default value: 25
- Melting Point Filter: '/tm' : Keep primers with a melting temperature in a
  given range. Example: '/tm 55.0,70.0', primers with 55.0<=tm<=70.0 Celcius are
  used, discarding the rest. Default value: 50ºC - 65ºC. Use '/notm' option to
  do not filter by melting Point.
- SantaLucia Melting Point: '/tmsantalucia' : Estimates the melting point of
  primers using Santa Lucia method. Reference: SantaLucia J Jr. A unified view
  of polymer, dumbbell, and oligonucleotide DNA nearest-neighbor thermodynamics.
  Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Feb 17;95(4):1460-5. By default: /tmsantalucia
  is used.
- Simple Melting Point: '/tmsimple' : Estimates the melting point of primers
  using the formula Tm = 2*AT+4*GC. Reference: Joseph Sambrook, E. F. Fritsch,
  Tom Maniatis. Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor
  Laboratory, 1989. By default: /tmsantalucia is used.
- 5' vs. 3' Thermodynamic Stability: '/end5v3' : Calculates the Delta_G values
  for the first (5') and last (3') five nucleotides of the primer and verifies
  that 5' is more stable than 3', according to a given Delta_G threshold value
  and experimental conditions. Delta_G-5' + delta_G_Limit < Delta_G-3'. Example:
  '/end5v3 1.5, 310, 0.05, 5', 1.5 is the Delta_G limit (in Kcal/mol), 310 is
  the Kelvin temperature used to estimate Delta_G values. 0.05 is the
  concetration of monovalent ions. Typically Na(+). 5 is the number of bases
  from each end that will be used to estimate delta_G difference. The values
  shown above are the dafault values. Use '/noend5v3' to do not filter by 5' vs
  3' thermodynamic stability.
- Base Runs Filter: '/baserun' : Discard primers that repeats the last base at
  least a given number of times. Example: '/baserun 4', discard primers that
  repeats 4, 5, or more times the last 3' base. Default value: 4. Use
  '/nobaserun' to do not filter by base runs.
- Homodimer Filter: '/homodimer' : Eliminate primers that can form a homodimer
  structure of a given number of bases in any part of the primer. Default value:
  5. Use '/nohomodimer' to do not filter homodimer structures.
- Homodimer At The 3' Filter: '/homodimer3' : Discard primers that can form
  homodimeric structures of a given size containing the 3' end. Dafault value:
  3. Use '/nohomodimer3' to do not filter homodimer structures at 3'.
- G+C Content Filter: '/gc' :  Keep primer primers whose G+C percent content
  ??are in a given range. Example: '/gc 30, 70' , primers with 30<=G+C<=70 are
  kept. Default value: 40 - 60 G+C %. Use '/nogc' to do not filter primers by
  its G+C content.
- Score Filter: '/score' : Discard primers whose score is lower than a given
  value. Default value: 0.8. Use '/noscore' to do not filter primers by score.
- Perform PCR Primer Pair Search: '/pair' : Searches primers in both strands of
  a given sequence in order to find primer pairs for PCR. This option allows the
  use of extra filters for primer pairs. By Default, single primer search are
  performed.
- Maximum Amplicon Size: '/size' : Search primers that can give a PCR product
  smaller or equal than a given size. Default value: 200. Use '/nosize' to do
  not limit the maximum size of a PCR product.
- Minimum Amplicon Size: '/minsize' : Search primers that can give a PCR product
  greater or equal than a given size. Default value: 100. Use '/nominsize' to do
  not limit the manimum size of a PCR product.
- G+C content compatibility: '/gccomp' : Calculates the difference of G+C
  content of the two primers and discard the pair if it is greater than a given
  value. Example: '/gccomp 20'. Keep pairs whose G+C content is smaller or equal
  to 20 %. Default value: 10 G+C %. Use '/nogccomp' to do not filter primer
  pairs by its G+C content.
- Hetero Dimer Filter: '/hetdimer' : Eliminate primer pairs that can form a
  heterodimer structure of a given number of bases in any part of the primer.
  Default value: 5. Use '/nohetdimer' to do not filter primer pairs that can
  form heterodimer structures.
- Heterodimer At The 3' Filter: '/hetdimer3' : Eliminate primer pairs that can
  form a heterodimer structure of a given number of bases containing the 3' end
  of any of the two primers.
- Default value: 3. Use '/nohetdimer3' to do not filter primer pairs that can
  form heterodimer structures at the 3' end.
- Tm Compatibility Filter: '/tmcomp' : Eliminate primer pairs with a difference
  in whose melting temperatures greater than a given value.
- Default value: 5 ºC. Use '/notmcomp' to do not check compatibility of melting
  points."
